## Sign in/ Sign up pages:
Bootstrap template was used here with edited fields and types. The design of this was intended to be super clean and easy to understand. Both pages link to each other in case you are on the sign up page but already have an account and vice versa.

## Booking page: 
The design goal of this page is to display the current week. Users who visit other cinema websites are familiar with this appearance and we don’t want to take away from what they use already. Once a date is selected it is intended to display all movies and the times that these movies will be shown.

## What’s on page:
Another familiar looking page for users who have used other online cinema sites. The current selection of movies are displayed in row formation for easy viewing.

## Contact us page:
A page for users to submit feedback and find any additional information they may need about us like our location, contact number etc. this page is designed with two vertical sections with the left producing a feedback form and the right producing additional information about the business.

## Movies pages: 
The design here is used over for multiple pages representing a movie this has a similar design to what you might find on the imc cinema website. A nice high quality image on the right with text floating left. A image with a hidden link to bring the user to a trailer on youtube for the movie page you are on.  This page adds an additional way to get to the booking page. By clicking the buttons that display the available times you will be redirected to the booking page.

## Additional design details:
The overall site takes inspiration from bootstrap but also custom css wrote by us to get a unique take on it. We tried to stick to a steady color scheme with a grey/black navigation bar at the top of the page, a common background image and a simple copyright footer at the foot of each page. It is made easy to get to where you want from any page on the site.

## Additional information:
We weren't sure if we should create second main.scala.html just for movies and the way it would work is, we’d pass few parameters like movie title, movie genre, movie length etc. The problem with it is that we thought it’s not good to pass that many parameters. Another idea was just to pass date and times for that movie playing. This can be done for part b if we get feedback on it. 

## Faced problems:
I(Tymoteusz) spent a lot of fixing problem with glyphicons. It didn't display the icons but I found out that I had add font folder for glyphicopns to work.
